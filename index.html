<p>
  The goal of this course in bioinformatics
  is for you to learn how to analyze large biological datasets,
  with a particular focus on genomic data. This hands-on class will cover basic
  concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data
  management, and task automation.  You are encouraged to
  help each another on assignments and apply what you learn to
  research problems outside of class.
</p>

<p id="who">
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at juniors, seniors, and masters students,
  particularly those who are working on independent research projects.
</p>

<p id="Computers">
  <strong>Computers:</strong> Because this is a bioinformatics class,
  you will need a computer. Bring your laptop to class every day if you have one.
  You should install the necessary software (see <a href="setup.html">instructions</a>). If you do not have a laptop or
  choose not to bring yours to class you can use the computers in the lab.

<p id="etherpad">
  We will use Etherpad for chatting, taking notes, and sharing URLs and bits of code. Links are provided on the website for each topic.
